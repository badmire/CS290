# CS290

Final project for CS290 to build a webserver and website using the nodejs framework. This website is the landing page and hub for a homebrewed Magic: The Gathering format. The UI/UX portion of the project was for class, and the python based listbuilder was a personal project.

The listbuilder uses the scryfall API to pull and parse card data, as well as keep the most current price data on cards.

This project was fairly early in my CS acedemic career, and many of the approaches are naive but effective. Were I to redo this project with my current skillset, I think it would be much more elegant and functional. As it stands, it is still a good example of my understanding of both front and backend web development, as well as my knowledge of both javascript and python.
